# Vagrant PHP Development Environment

## Introduction
Developing fast requires a fast development environment being built on every developer computer. We will attempt to make it available under a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) + [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) + [Docker](https://www.docker.com) provisioning on every operating system, based on Debian Jessie.

The following instructions assume you have a basic understanding on how to execute command line calls and to install packages on your operating system.

# Installation
To be able to install the development environment, you will to download and install on your operating system:
- Virtualbox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

You will also need a GIT client. Depending on your operating system, you may need to choose a different one. For Windows and MacOS users, you can use the Atlassian SourceTree client to have a nice GUI included. For more information, please refer to https://www.sourcetreeapp.com.

Assuming you have already installed the previous indicated software and you have done all the requirement steps, we will now start to install the environment.
